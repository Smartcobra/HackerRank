Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero.
 Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with 6 places after the decimal.

Note: This challenge introduces precision problems. The test cases are scaled to six decimal places,
though answers with absolute error of up to 10 ^-4 are acceptable.

example-
arr=[1 1 0 -1 -1]
   2 positive  2/5=0.4000
   2 negative  2/5=0.4000
   1 zero       1/5=0.2000
